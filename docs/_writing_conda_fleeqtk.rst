This is the skeleton of a tool wrapping the parody bioinformatics software package fleeqtk_.
fleeqtk is a fork of the project seqtk_ that many Planemo tutorials are built around and the
example tool should hopefully be fairly familiar. fleeqtk version 1.3 can be downloaded
from `here <https://github.com/jmchilton/fleeqtk/archive/v1.3.tar.gz>`__ and built using
``make``. The result of ``make`` includes a single executable ``fleeqtk``.
