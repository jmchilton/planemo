.. note:: Planemo doesn't yet expose options that make it possible to build mulled
    containers for local packages that have yet to be published to anaconda.org
    but the mulled toolkit allows this. See mulled_ documentation for more
    information. However, once a container for a local package is built with
    ``mulled-build-tool`` the ``--biocontainers`` command should work to test
    it.
